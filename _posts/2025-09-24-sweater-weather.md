My head hurts a little bit. But I made it through this assignment alive! The task was to write a program that tells you what to wear depending on the temperature, using **if**, **else if**, **else**, as well as the **&&** and **||** operators.

Here's my work:

A tip for my past self: Always double-check whether youâ€™re using = (assignment) or == (equal to) appropriately!!! I had a deeply harrowing few minutes of confusion because of this mistake while working on the assignment, and I don't want to experience that ever again thank you very much.
