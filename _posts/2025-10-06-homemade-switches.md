For this assignment, I added two LEDs to my sewing sampler and incorporated two "homemade" switches to the circuit. One switch consists of two conductive thread patches (one sewn onto the fabric itself, one on separate piece of felt), the other consists of a paperclip and a piece of conductive fabric. "Pressing" the components of each switch together turns the lights on!

I decided to put the LEDs at the back since the light still shows through without disrupting the front of the work!
