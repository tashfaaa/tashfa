This project involved building a light-up plushy through a circuit made with conductive thread. The goal was to connect a battery, three LEDs, a button, and a switch in a way that allows the LEDs to turn on only when the button is being pressed and the switch is on. I started by mapping out my circuit on paper and testing it with alligator clips. Without doing that, I most definitely would have messed up the actual circuit. 

I encountered some hiccups along the way but ultimately survived:
1. Had to use tape to keep all the components in place while I was sewing with the conductive thread which made life slightly easier.
2. Some parts of my whip stitch are wonky but we move.
3. My smallest needle was too thick to go through the anchoring holes of the battery holder, so I had to improvise and figure out a way to sew around it in a way that was functional and would actually hold the battery in place.
4. For a moment, aesthetic value blinded me, and I didn't do a consistent running stitch in one small part (namely where the positive ends of all my LEDs connect) so the thread would be hidden inside. Upon some reflection (and a closer reading of the assignment instructions), I realized that was probably not the best choice? Needless to say, the running stitch was used in all other places with the conductive thread. Lesson learnt. And the circuit seems to be working fine! At least for now!

A tip based on these experiences: Temporarily securing components somehow so you don't have to worry about them moving all over the place while sewing is super helpful!! Also probably donâ€™t underestimate how much easier your life will be if you test your circuit constantly. It saves one from having to unpick a ton of thread later.

## My Plushy
(I decided to decorate my plushy with a singular mysterious embroidered eye.)
