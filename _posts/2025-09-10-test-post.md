I like the green.

Hi! I'm Tashfa.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Class of 2027!</summary>
For now?
</details>

I'm a **Comparative Literature** major + **Asian Studies** concentrator. Which is to say it's been a while since I've read a book for non-academic purposes. 

### My Sewing & Programming Experience

I literally have none. Never sewed. Never programmed. Hence the scaredness.

### Why am I here?

I'm curious about sewing/combining technology with mundane, tangible items. Hopefully this class will help me do that :D

### One Boring Fact About Me

I have watched 65 movies for free at Images Cinema over the last two years.

### Some Photos For Fun

I'm going to put a photo of my bookshelf here in place of the crepe!
