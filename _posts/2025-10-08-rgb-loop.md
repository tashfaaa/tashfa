For this assignment, we had to write a program that simulates turning on LED colors in a sequence. The program runs a loop a set number of times, and every 10th iteration it prints one of three colors: RED, GREEN, or BLUE. Each color is printed three times before switching to the next, repeating the pattern. To do this, I needed a way to keep track of both the total loop count and how many times a color had been printed so far, which was a bit tricky at first. I used the modulo operator (%) twice, once to check when the loop number was a multiple of 10, and again to cycle through the colors every three prints.


**Here's the output with runTimes = 110:**

**Tip:** Something I’m realizing more and more with these programming assignments is that I don’t instantly remember newer concepts we’ve learned. Having more practice definitely helps, so my tip is to not panic if things don’t make perfect sense right away. It’s okay to go back to class notes, lecture slides, or previous pogils to fully understand and apply new concepts properly. With more time and practice, it will hopefully click.
