Hi! I'm Tashfa.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Class of 2027!</summary>
For now?
</details>

I'm a **Comparative Literature** major + **Asian Studies** concentrator. Which is to say it's been a while since I've read a book for non-academic purposes. 

### my sewing & programming experience

I literally have none. Never sewed. Never programmed. Hence the fear of spooky stem.

### why am i here?/hopes for this class

I've always wanted to learn how to sew! I'm also curious about the role of technology alongside mundane, tangible, every-day things around us.

### one boring fact about me.

I have watched 65 movies for free at Images Cinema over the last two years.

### a photo of my bookshelves. just for fun.
