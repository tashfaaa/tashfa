I am very passionate about all sorts of fried potatoes, so I decided to make this assignment fry-centered, if you will. I created a simple C program that shows a full menu—either the regular fries menu or the secret fries menu—based solely on whether a number I set in the code is even or odd. Specifically, when the number is odd, the program displays the secret menu, and vice versa. The output displays the entire selected menu along with a message showing the specific fry “ordered,” based on the input values. If the meal choice is invalid (anything other than 1, 2, or 3), it prompts you to pick a valid option.

**Here's a couple screenshots of possible outputs:**

**Tip:** Commenting as you go saves time compared to trying to remember your thought process after finishing the whole program! Especially if you're coming back to the assignment after a while :)
