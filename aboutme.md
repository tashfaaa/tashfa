I’ve realized that a lot of tech in my life—like apps, even ones meant to help with mental health—often just makes things worse for me when I’m stressed or anxious. Truly manageable support is hard to find in endless scrolling. This is an experience I know many of my friends at Williams deal with; we’re always trying to find ways of connecting, resting, reminding ourselves to talk a breather amid the fast-paced nature of our lives at college. I’m taking electronic textiles because I’m curious about how everyday wearable items could help. Maybe a sweater could remind you to take a couple of deep breath, or a plushie could play a comfort song for you. I don’t have a CS background, so this class is my chance to experiment hands-on with simple, feasible ideas. My goal is to explore how wearable fabrics could genuinely support mental well-being in ways that aren’t overwhelming!
